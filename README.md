### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anugunj Naman, I'm 21 years old and I live in India.

I'm currently final year undergraduate at IIIT Guwahati. My interests lies in deep learning and reinforcement learning.

I enjoy working on AI/ML problems. So far, I've worked on the following problems:
- [PATH-Pavement-Assessment-Tracking-and-Health](https://github.com/AnugunjNaman/PATH-Pavement-Assessment-Tracking-and-Health-SIH2020): A Deep Learning Solution for Automation of Pavement Condition Index for Smart India Hackathon 2020.
- [Fixed-MAML](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01356.pdf): Few Shot Speech Emotion Recognition.
- [Multimodal Author Profiling System for Tweets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9482514/): Gender based Author Profiling of Tweets.
- [Indic Languages Automatic Speech Recognition using Meta-Learning Approach](https://aclanthology.org/2021.icnlsp-1.25.pdf): Efficient Speech Recognition for  Multiple Indic Languages.

I'm mostly working with PyTorch.
